- / route should always be at the end
- order of the routes matters (specific should always be at the first and generic should be at the end ----means /movies/2 should come first and /movies should be at the end)
- use method applies to all the requests irrespective of the method, to make them specific get, post, delete, patch, update methods are available, even if they are available if we use just "use" method, then it applies to all the methods so be aware of the order of the methods also. Always use use method at the end if at all to use it
- use of regex in routes, use of ? + * () in routes, /a/ ,/.*fly$/
- extracting query parameters using req.query

- error handling

- install mongoose
- get db connection string, use it to connect to the mongo server
- listen to the server after connecting to the db
- create schema and model
- create some dummy users and save them (post,/signup)
- use postman to make requests and handle the errors using try catch blocks
- request.body gives undefined if logged in the console. So, use a middleware like express.json() to convert it to object form from json
- (get,/user) filter by email
- (get,/feed) fetch all the users
- (delete,/user) using id
- (patch,/user) using id
- (patch, /user) using emailId
